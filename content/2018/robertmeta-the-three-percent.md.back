The 3% You Need To Know
========================================================================
Vim is an amazing editor, and you should take the time to dive deep and 
learn a lot of the features. This is the 3% of Vim I think you should
having in your toolbox. This isn't an ideal learning path, this won't 
start from the beginning, it won't end at the end. It is just the 
features I find most useful.

Vim has astounding documentation. 3500+ pages of it. Including a 341+
page user manual (written to be read cover to cover).
