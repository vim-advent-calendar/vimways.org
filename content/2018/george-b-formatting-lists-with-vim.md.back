## Use of formatoptions and the fo-table

We tell Vim how formatting should be carried out by setting `'formatoptions'`. This is set to a string of characters whose meaning is described in `:help fo-table`. Rather than repeating what's in the help it's sufficient to say the default is `formatoptions=tcq`, which may lead users to think that invoking Vim's formatting with `gw` from Normal mode simply wraps text at whatever `'textwidth'` is set to. But we can actually do a lot more.

The focus of this article is how we can alter the formatting behaviour when we have the `n` value present in `'formatoptions'`. This allows formatting operations to recognise lists, thereby avoiding joining distinct items as if they were a single paragraph.

## Understanding formatlistpat

The default value of `'formatlistpat'` is succinctly described in the documentation:

```text
The default recognizes a number, followed by an optional punctuation
character and white space.
```

This translates to the regular expression `^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*`.

Atom | Description
---|---
`^`         | From the start of line
`\s*`       | Zero or more whitespace characters
`\d\+`      | One or more digits
`[`         | Start a character class
`\]:.)}\t`  | A closing bracket, colon, full stop, closing parenthesis, closing curly brace, tab, or space
`]`         | End a character class
`\s*`       | Zero or more whitespace characters

Here is an example of a list that can be formatted by executing `gwip`:

```text
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
2. Donec feugiat a quam id faucibus.
3. Sed maximus efficitur commodo.
4. Sed et euismod ex.
5. Sed at libero placerat, pretium sem sit amet, mattis dolor.
```

However something like the following won't be recognised:

```text
a. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
b. Donec feugiat a quam id faucibus.
c. Sed maximus efficitur commodo.
d. Sed et euismod ex.
e. Sed at libero placerat, pretium sem sit amet, mattis dolor.
```

## Expanding formatlistpat

An item of particular importance when setting `'formatlistpat'` is that we will need to enter more backslashes than you may expect. This is because when setting string options in Vim backslashes need to be escaped (covered in `:help option-backslash`). As an example let's see how we would set `formatlistpat` to its default value of `^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*`.

```vim
set formatlistpat=^\\s*\\d\\+[\\]:.)}\\t\ ]\\s*
```

Now, to use the example of the alphabetical listing used earlier, how may we change `'formatlistpat'` to recognise this as a list? Changing the matching of a digit to a group matching a digit or an alphabetic character seems like a simple solution. We could do so with the following (note the three backslashes that precede the pipe).

```vim
set formatlistpat=^\\s*\\(\\d\\\|\\a\\)\\+[\\]:.)}\\t\ ]\\s*
```

However this will end up matching too many structures of text. The punctuation-matching character class, after the digits or alphabetic characters, also includes a space, so the regular expression would also match any word followed by a space. We could remove the space in the character class to avoid this like so:

```vim
set formatlistpat=^\\s*\\(\\d\\\|\\a\\)\\+[\\]:.)}\\t]\\s*
```

Though, as one may expect, by removing something that was in the default setting, we've broken the matching of lists that are prefixed by numbers alone. I.e. "1. " is still recognised, but "1 " no longer is. Rather than continuing example after example, I'll stop here, and what I consider to be a comprehensive solution for my personal needs will follow in the final section.

## Some filetypes will set formatlistpat

It is interesting to note that Vim will set `'formatlistpat'` for some filetypes. At the time of writing this consists of the following:

```vim
runtime/ftplugin/rmd.vim:      setlocal formatlistpat=^\\s*\\d\\+\\.\\s\\+\\\|^\\s*[-*+]\\s\\+
runtime/ftplugin/rrst.vim:     setlocal formatlistpat=^\\s*\\d\\+\\.\\s\\+\\\|^\\s*[-*+]\\s\\+
runtime/ftplugin/markdown.vim: setlocal formatlistpat=^\\s*\\d\\+\\.\\s\\+\\\|^[-*+]\\s\\+\\\|^\\[^\\ze[^\\]]\\+\\]:
```

This is just something to bear in mind if you find `'formatlistpat'` set to something unexpected or if you had been wondering how formatting of lists in your markdown files had "just worked" for example.

# Other settings that can interfere with formatlistpat

Vim has a notion of comments which can lead to formatting not working as you may expect. For example if we were to open a file named `list.txt` with the following content.

```text
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
* Donec feugiat a quam id faucibus.
* Sed maximus efficitur commodo.
* Sed et euismod ex.
* Sed at libero placerat, pretium sem sit amet, mattis dolor.
```

Executing `gwip` does *not* join the lines. As we have already covered the default value for `'formatlistpat'` expects list items to at least be denoted with a digit, so what's happening here? From the previous section about filetypes it doesn't seem that `'formatlistpat'` is being modified for this example. We can check this and see that sure enough it's the default value.

```vim
:set formatlistpat?
  formatlistpat=^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*
```

So why do we have this behaviour? Is Vim recognising this as a list by some other means? Yes, sort of. Vim's understanding of a comment also extends to lists and is not defined by `'formatlistpat'`. Specifically in this example of a file with the "text" `'filetype'` we have the following.

```vim
:verbose set comments?
  comments=fb:-,fb:*
        Last set from /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.1.0450/share/vim/vim81/ftplugin/text.vim line 16
```

The various settings for `'comments'` are of course covered in Vim's help (see `:help format-comments`), but let's breakdown the value above:

Part | Description
---|---
`f`  | Flag denoting only the first line has this string
`b`  | Flag denoting whitespace is required after the string
`:`  | Delimiter denoting the end of flags
`-`  | The string literal `-`
`,`  | Delimiter denoting ending of a setting
`f`  | Flag denoting only the first line has this string
`b`  | Flag denoting whitespace is required after the string
`:`  | Delimiter denoting the end of flags
`*`  | String literal `*`

The usage of the `f` flag may seem slightly confusing given the prior example. But becomes clearer if we try and format a line that exceeds `'textwidth'`, here we are again in a buffer with the `'filetype'` of "text".

```text
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec feugiat a quam id faucibus.
```

Executing `gwip` will yield the following.

```text
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec feugiat a quam
  id faucibus.
```

Here we see the second line is not prefixed with an asterisk. This is in keeping with the description of the `f` flag in `'comments'`. So, going back to our earlier example, Vim did not reflow the paragraph as a whole when we executed `gwip` since it treats each line as an individual list item with the notion of being a "comment".

## My personal customisations for notes

I often open Vim to write up emails and replies for ticketing systems. In such instances Vim has no `'filetype'` set. As such in order to associate various setting with such a buffer I give it a pseudo filetype.

```vim
function! EmptyBuffer()
  if @% == ""
    setfiletype txt
  endif
endfunction
```

I simply call the function above upon entering Vim with an autocommand.

```vim
autocmd vimrc BufEnter * call EmptyBuffer()
```

I also set this pseudo filetype for any "blank" buffers I pull up, here the autocommand is making use of `:setfiletype` to set the filetype only if it has not otherwise been set.

```vim
autocmd vimrc BufRead,BufNewFile * setfiletype txt
```

I then have a function which I call when the pseudo filetype of "txt" has been set. Below is a truncated version so as to illustrate only the formatting settings.

```vim
function! PlainText()
  setlocal comments=
endfunction

autocmd vimrc FileType txt call PlainText()
```

Why am I setting `'comments'` to an empty value? Well as described in the help it assumes, like many other things in Vim, that you are working with something resembling C code. As such this can cause issues if we match lists that use asterisks in `'formatlistpat'`.

As a note for the more savvy reader, you may be thinking why not make this "pseudo filetype" a fully-fledged filetype with its own files somewhere in my `'runtimepath'`? This is simply a personal preference: I prefer a more monolithic organisation of my configuration.

And finally my `'formatlistpat'`.

```vim
set formatlistpat=^\\s*                     " Optional leading whitespace
set formatlistpat+=[                        " Start character class
set formatlistpat+=\\[({]\\?                " |  Optionally match opening punctuation
set formatlistpat+=\\(                      " |  Start group
set formatlistpat+=[0-9]\\+                 " |  |  Numbers
set formatlistpat+=\\\|                     " |  |  or
set formatlistpat+=[a-zA-Z]\\+              " |  |  Letters
set formatlistpat+=\\)                      " |  End group
set formatlistpat+=[\\]:.)}                 " |  Closing punctuation
set formatlistpat+=]                        " End character class
set formatlistpat+=\\s\\+                   " One or more spaces
set formatlistpat+=\\\|                     " or
set formatlistpat+=^\\s*[-–+o*•]\\s\\+      " Bullet points
```

This handles a broader range of lists.

```text
1.  Typical item the default handles
a.  An item with an alphabetic character and punctuation
(2) An item with punctuation preceding and following it
•   An item consisting of leading punctuation
```

I hope this has shown how to extend Vim's `'formatlistpat'` and how other settings interplay with it.
